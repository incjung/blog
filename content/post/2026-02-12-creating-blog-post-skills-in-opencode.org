* Introduction

Managing a blog efficiently requires balancing content creation with technical workflows. As a developer who maintains a Hugo-based blog, I found myself repeatedly performing the same tasks: creating new posts with proper frontmatter, formatting content, and deploying changes. This repetitive workflow was the perfect candidate for automation using Opencode's Agent Skills feature.

In this post, I'll share how I created three custom skills to streamline my blogging workflow: one for creating posts with AI-generated content, another for deploying with secure token authentication, and a third for formatting and validation. These skills now handle the boilerplate work, allowing me to focus on what matters most - writing quality content.

* Prerequisites

Before implementing these skills, ensure you have:

- Opencode installed and configured
- A Hugo blog repository set up
- Git configured with write access to your repository
- A personal access token for authentication (stored as BLOG_GIT_TOKEN environment variable)
- Basic understanding of YAML frontmatter and Markdown/Org-mode syntax

My specific setup uses Hugo with Netlify for deployment, and I primarily write in Org-mode format. The skills can be adapted for Markdown or other static site generators with minor modifications.

* Core Concepts

** What are Agent Skills?

Opencode's Agent Skills are reusable instruction sets defined in SKILL.md files. They allow the AI to understand specific workflows and perform complex tasks autonomously. Skills are discovered from .opencode/skills/ directory or global config locations.

** Skill Structure

Each skill requires:
- YAML frontmatter with name, description, and metadata
- Clear workflow definitions
- Usage examples and error handling guidance
- Prerequisites and security considerations

** Why Three Separate Skills?

Separating concerns into distinct skills provides flexibility:
- Create posts without immediate deployment
- Format existing content independently
- Deploy changes without creating new posts

This modular approach follows Unix philosophy - do one thing well.

* Step-by-Step Tutorial

** Setting Up the Skills Directory

First, create the directory structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/blog-post-create
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/blog-deploy
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/blog-format
#+END_SRC

** Creating the blog-post-create Skill

This skill handles the most complex workflow: generating a complete blog post with AI-written content. The key innovation is the content generation prompt that produces structured, technical tutorials combined with learning notes.

The skill follows this sequence:
1. Receive topic from user
2. Create file with Hugo frontmatter
3. Generate 2000-3000 characters of content across 8 sections
4. Start Hugo server for live preview

** Creating the blog-deploy Skill

Deployment requires secure authentication. The skill uses environment variables to avoid exposing tokens:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export BLOG_GIT_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
#+END_SRC

The skill handles:
- Git status check
- Draft to published conversion
- Commit and push with token authentication
- Deployment verification

** Creating the blog-format Skill

This utility skill provides:
- Frontmatter validation
- Org-mode/Markdown formatting
- Image path fixing
- Content conversion between formats

* Code Examples

Here's the structure of the blog-post-create SKILL.md:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
---
name: blog-post-create
description: Create new blog post with AI-generated content
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
---

## Required Sections for Content Generation:

1. Introduction (200-300 chars)
2. Prerequisites (100-200 chars)
3. Core Concepts (500-700 chars)
4. Step-by-Step Tutorial (600-800 chars)
5. Code Examples (300-400 chars)
6. Real-world Applications (200-300 chars)
7. Tips and Best Practices (200-300 chars)
8. Conclusion and References (100-200 chars)

## Content Style:
- Technical Tutorial + Learning Notes hybrid
- Specific, actionable instructions
- Real version numbers and commands
- Runnable code examples
#+END_SRC

And the deployment workflow:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Check status
git status

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new post: $TITLE"

# Push with token
git push origin main
#+END_SRC

* Real-World Applications

These skills have transformed my blogging workflow:
#+begin_example
** Rapid Prototyping:** I can now test blog ideas instantly. When a technical concept comes to mind, I create a post in minutes rather than hours.

** Consistent Quality:** The structured content generation ensures every post has comprehensive coverage - from prerequisites to best practices.

** Reduced Friction:** The removal of boilerplate tasks means I write more frequently. The barrier to "just start writing" is significantly lower.

** Teaching and Documentation:** The same skills help me create consistent documentation for work projects and tutorials for colleagues.

#+end_example

* Tips and Best Practices
#+begin_example
** Security First:** Never commit your BLOG_GIT_TOKEN to the repository. Use environment variables or a secure credential manager.

** Customization:** Adapt the content generation prompt to match your writing style. The current structure balances technical depth with accessibility.

** Version Control:** Keep your skills under version control but ensure .opencode/skills/ is committed so the workflow is reproducible.

** Testing:** Always preview locally with hugo server before deploying. The draft flag in frontmatter prevents premature publication.

** Iteration:** Use the blog-format skill regularly to maintain consistency across your archive, not just new posts.

* Conclusion and References

Creating Opencode skills for blog management has been a game-changer for my writing workflow. By automating repetitive tasks and leveraging AI for content generation, I can focus on providing value to readers rather than wrestling with technical details.

The modular approach means I can improve each skill independently - better content generation without touching deployment logic, or enhanced formatting without affecting creation workflows.

Start small, iterate often, and let your tools handle the boilerplate so you can focus on what matters - sharing knowledge with your audience.
