Love =org-mode= but when I use source block in it, the font is suck. So I tried to change my font of Emacs with ~(set-frame-font "Consolas-11" t t)~, but it didn't affect the =org code block=.
I didn't know it =org face= has differnt faces and enherit. That is =org-table face= and =org-block face= inherit from ~fixed-pitch~ so you can set the font for that face with. But most other faces inherit from default but not these two.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Consolas-11")
#+end_src

This function overrides the face attributes specified by FACEâ€™s face spec. It is mostly intended for internal use only.
