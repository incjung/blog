Latex is the best documentation tool, but the huge commands cann't be in my mind. Actaully, I want my document looks like good outline and a bit good structure. I don't need all ~latex~ fancy features.

I didn't use the ~Latex~ when my PhD thesis written at all. It's because I am not confident using the all ~Latex~ features. Are you?

No worries no more. ~org-mode~ will save you. I am using a bunch of features of ~Latex~ thanks to ~org-mode~ latex output. Type ~Ctrl-c Ctrl-e~ to export ~Latex~ and publish ~PDF~ output. Isn't cool?

I am using the ~org-mode~ for writing my technical reports in company. So far so good.

Today, I will show you how to generate a front page like book cover. ~Latex~ world calls it /titlepage/. Here is my example 

#+begin_example
#+OPTIONS: title:nil toc:nil date:t num:t H:3 email:t author:t

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{titlepage}
\begin{center}
\vspace*{1cm}
\Huge
\textbf{XX-TITLE-XX}

\vspace{1cm}
\Large
XX-PROJECT-NAME-XX

\vspace{1cm}
{\Large XX-PROJECT-NAME-XX \par}
\vspace{2cm}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{C:/Users/jungi/hpe/exploer}
\end{center}

\vfill
Inchul Jung \\
\end{titlepage}
#+END_EXPORT

\pagebreak
\thispagestyle{empty}
\tableofcontents
\pagebreak
\setcounter{page}{1}

#+end_example

{{< figure src="./titlepage.jpg" alt="" >}}

Don't enable /title/ and /toc/ in your ~#+OPTIONS~.
