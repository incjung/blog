as alwasy, I did think what I should do this new year, 2023. 

{{< figure src="https://incjjung.netlify.app/images/2023-01-05.png" alt="" >}}

there are some patterns that I always do. no promise just spilling out.

** personal happiness
- happy family: eat, drink and smiles
- happy people: community, hobby
- health: walk and excercise

** improvement
- review always: blog and check where i am 
- *English* : input (reading,watching,listening)
- book: engineer and philosopy
- pattern recognition: my life and external world
- money
- PR of aus
  
** house
- never have it in K- and N-. But wodner if I could start to hope
- check loan for R3 and B2 at least. more R4 and b2.
- apartment is going to be not a option. becuase we should sell it later to reduce size.

** produce
- pdf, ebook: maybe org-mode (knowledge) and elisp for workflow
- logic
