I found a article on [[https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230104-layoff-linkedin-goodbye-posts][``Following mass layoffs, workers are taking to social media to write long goodbyes praising companies who have just let them go. Why?'']]


It's famous that US Job Market is high flexiable. I have been working in Asia region, so perhaps I don't know exact situation of them. 
I sometimes have got a question about my job statue when there are some articles like that. 

Anyway, this article is worth of reading. I have been avoiding to think it and refuse to think it. But I need to have a stragical mindset in the hard situation.

SNS is not only personal fun tool. It can be used for reputation platform to sell myself. Keep in mind that "I didn't want to write something that I'd end up regretting. You lean to never burn bridges". 

Use it for selling me as posting a farewell message, then I can let people know I am available to public.
