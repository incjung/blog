I did create a function to copy a image file and blogged it at [[https://incjjung.netlify.app/post/2022/hugo-img-my-copy/][this link]]
~easy-hugo-mycopy-image~ is only for one image copying. But I'd like to create a new function to copy multi images in case.

to do it, I need a way to select multi files and I decided the =dired= to mark multi files.
 - ~dired-get-marked-files~:  marked file list

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun to-myblog-image-dir (args)
      "copy my images into blog's image dir.
      requre: easy-hugo-basedir val.
      2022-12-29 by Inchul"
      (interactive "P")
      (save-window-excursion
        (let ((my-hugo-img-dir (concat easy-hugo-basedir "/static/images/"))) 
          (mapc (lambda (filename)
                  (progn 
                    (message "%s to %s" filename (expand-file-name
                                                  (file-name-nondirectory filename)
                                                  (expand-file-name my-hugo-img-dir)))
                    (copy-file filename (expand-file-name
                                                 (file-name-nondirectory filename)
                                                 (expand-file-name my-hugo-img-dir)))))
                (dired-get-marked-files)))))

#+end_src

To use this function, firstly, change mode into =dired= and mark files which you want to copy into blog. and ~M-x to-myblog-image-dir~.
