I am a super fan of org mode, and use it for my work. ex, meeting minutes, reports, etc. org mode doesn't disappoint me as always, it's super fancy. But for some reasons, I sometimes need a complex table form. I hope not you don't need, but it's what it is.
You can't merge cells with org table because the org mode tries to separate each columns and rows and keep the cell space effectively.

Let's say you want blanks to get signatures in your report. org table would be like
#+begin_example
|--------+--------|
| me     | you    |
|--------+--------|
| name:  | Name   |
| Title: | Title: |
#+end_example
you should put some options here. If you know latex package, =tblr(https://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/macros/latex/contrib/tabularray/tabularray.pdf)=, you can use like:

#+begin_example
#+attr_latex: :environment tblr :align Q[5cm]Q[5cm]
|--------+--------|
| me     | yo u   |
|--------+--------|
| name:  | Name   |
| Title: | Title: |
#+end_example

Not bad. But if you need a complex example, it's better to use latex instead of org table.

#+begin_example
\\begin{center}
\\begin{tblr}{|l|l|l|}
\\hline
Test ID & \\SetCell[c=2]{c} core \\\\
\\hline
Test Title &\\SetCell[c=2]{c} Web Server \\\\
\\hline
Cluster ID &\\SetCell[c=2]{c} XXXXXX \\\\
\\hline
\\hline
Test Descrition/Activity & \\SetCell{c,30mm} Test Result & \\SetCell{c,30mm}  Remark\\\\
\\hline
{Login to Portal  \\\\
- Open Web Browser to htts://ab.c.d } & & \\\\
\\hline
\\end{tblr}
\\end{center}
#+end_example

This latex merged 3 columns into 2 columns.
