# ACC Treatment Injury Data

This includes:
- diagnosis, advice and interventions
- failure to provide treatment or failure to provide treatment in a timely manner. The injury must have been caused by treatment; but not be a necessary part, or ordinary consequence, of the treatment.


## Injury Prevention: Making treatment safer
The best way to improve treatment safety is for us to work in collaboration with those on the front line. We have six key initiatives that address:
- surgical safety
- infection prevention and surveillance
- pressure injuries
- medication safety
- clinical incident reviews
- brain injuries in newborns.

We've committed a $45 million investment to treatment safety programmes between 2017 and 2022. We work with the Health Quality and Safety Commission (HQSC), the Ministry of Health (MoH), District Health Boards (DHBs) and others to deliver these initiatives. Find out more about the initiatives:
https://www.acc.co.nz/for-providers/treatment-safety/

To encourage conversations around treatment safety, we've released detailed information on treatment injuries in public and private surgical hospitals.

- Term Defintion: 
New claim : The claims in these tables have been counted by the date that the claim was accepted with ACC. 
Active claims :	A claim that is open and has received a payment in that financial year. The claim could be a new claim accepted during that year or an existing claim.
