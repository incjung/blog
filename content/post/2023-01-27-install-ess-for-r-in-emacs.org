~R~ is my best option for data analisys and I have been using R for many projects. When I use R, of course, =Rstudio= is a only tool I need. ~Rmd~ is a perfect to keep every information during R session.

You know that most of my time are spent with Elisp these days, so I'd like to integrate R with emacs. ~ESS~ is only the package in Emacs and very easy to configure it. Nothing special.

Here is my init.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; R location
  (setq inferior-R-program "C:/Progra~1/R/R-4.2.2/bin/x64/Rterm.exe")

  
  (setq ess-startup-directory "/someware directory/")  ;; where the R files will be locasted

  ;; Rstudio Styple
  ;; (setq display-buffer-alist
  ;;       '(("^\\*R Dired"
  ;;          (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window)
  ;;          (side . right)
  ;;          (slot . -1)
  ;;          (window-width . 0.33)
  ;;          (reusable-frames . nil))
  ;;         ("^\\*R"
  ;;          (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom)
  ;;          (window-width . 0.5)
  ;;          (reusable-frames . nil))
  ;;         ("^\\*Help"
  ;;          (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window)
  ;;          (side . right)
  ;;          (slot . 1)
  ;;          (window-width . 0.33)
  ;;          (reusable-frames . nil))))


  ;; Separate Emacs frame for R
  ;; (setq display-buffer-alist
  ;;              '(("^\\*R"
  ;;                 (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
  ;;                 (reusable-frames . 0))))


#+end_src
