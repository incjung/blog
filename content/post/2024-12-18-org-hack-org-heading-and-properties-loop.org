- =(org-map-entries FUNC &optional MATCH SCOPE &rest SKIP)=: all FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE. TThe call to FUNC will be wrapped into a ‘save-excursion’ form, so FUNC does not need to preserve point.

- =(org-get-heading &optional NO-TAGS NO-TODO NO-PRIORITY NO-COMMENT)=: Return the heading of the current entry, without the stars.

- =(org-get-entry)=: Get the entry text, after heading, entire subtree.

- =(org-entry-get POM PROPERTY &optional INHERIT LITERAL-NIL)=: Get value of PROPERTY for entry or content at point-or-marker POM.
