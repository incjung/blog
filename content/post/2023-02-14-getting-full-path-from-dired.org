title: "2023 02 14 Getting Full Path From Dired"

While I write my =org= files, I sometimes need to know some full path of files or directories. It's sick of opening a windows explore and copy the full path from it. Let's make the process simple.

I usually use =dired= to go and search files/directoreies. There's the fuctions that I use to develop my new function. 

- used elisp functions
  - ~dired-get-filename~ : In Dired, return name of file mentioned on this line.
  - ~kill-new~ : Make STRING the latest kill in the kill ring.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun my/dired-get-full-path ()
    "get full path
  2023-02-14 by Inchul"
    (interactive)
    (message "file selected file: %s"  (dired-get-filename))
    (kill-new (dired-get-filename)))
#+end_src
