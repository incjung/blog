* The Problem: Context Switching Kills Learning

When I'm reading an English article or technical documentation in Emacs, I often encounter unfamiliar words or confusing sentences. My usual workflow was:

1. Highlight the word/phrase
2. Switch to a browser or dictionary app
3. Search for the meaning
4. Switch back to Emacs
5. Try to remember what I was reading...

By the time I return, I've lost the flow. The context switch breaks immersion and makes consistent learning difficult.

* The Solution: NeuralLingo

I built *NeuralLingo* to solve this exact problem. It's an Emacs package that brings an AI-powered English tutor directly into your editing environment—no context switching required.

Press a shortcut key on any sentence, and Gemini 2.5 Flash (via Google AI Studio) provides:

- *Natural translations* with nuance explanations (formal vs. informal)
- *Pronunciation coaching* with linking and reduction tips
- *Etymology and mnemonics* for memorable learning
- *Real-world examples* you can use immediately
- *Interactive Q&A* - ask follow-up questions in the mini-buffer

The best part? Analyzed sentences stay highlighted in your buffer as a visual "error note," preserving your learning traces.
