It's very annoying to search a word in ~emacs~. The default setting for `searching word' is with ~C - s~. But you have to fill in the word looking for manually.

Why not search directly the work on current word that I am pointing? Google it if you have question, then be found. :)

I could find good tutorial at `http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/modernization_isearch.html'. You should read it. This code is all I want.

But I am using ~(livy mode)~ instead of ~(isearch-mode)~ in my ~Emacs~, so just changed it with ~swiper-isearch~ of ~livy~ and changed the function name. Sorry Xah.

* search with current point word
with ~<f8>~ key, you can search a word on current curser

    (let ( $p1 $p2 )
      (if (use-region-p)

            (setq $p1 (region-beginning))
