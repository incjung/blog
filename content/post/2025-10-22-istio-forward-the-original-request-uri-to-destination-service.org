In Kubernetes, the concept of a Virtual Service is an Istio networking resource, not a native Kubernetes object. It provides a powerful way to define routing rules, allowing you to manipulate a request's destination host and path.

Let's say, to manipulate the request's URI path, you define path-matching rules within the Virtual Service's HTTP routes and use the /rewrite/ field to change the URI before the request is forwarded to its destination. The destination host for a Virtual Service is the name of a real service in the Istio service registry (typically a Kubernetes service).

The general process involves two main steps:
1) Match incoming requests based on criteria, such as a URI prefix.
2) Rewrite the URI before forwarding the request to a specific destination host

The following example show how to rewrite a path (ex, =api/v1/products= to =/products=)
Be careful with the URI PATH, it will be exactly replaced with the PATH
#+begin_src yaml
  apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
  kind: VirtualService
  metadata:
    name: productpage-rewrite
  spec:
    # The host the client uses to access the service.
    # This can be the Gateway host or an internal service FQDN.
    hosts:
      - "productpage.default.svc.cluster.local" 
    http:
    - match:
      - uri:
          prefix: "/api/v1/products" # Match requests starting with this path
      rewrite:
        uri: "/products" # Rewrite the path to this value
      route:
      - destination:
          # The real destination Kubernetes service.
          host: productpage.default.svc.cluster.local 
          port:
            number: 9080
#+end_src

If you *omit* the =http.rewrite.uri= field in the Istio Virtual Service, the original request URI will be forwarded to the destination service without any changes

- with =http.rewrite.uri=, User Request with =/api/v1/products/123= will be Destination Service, =/products/123=
- without =http.rewrite.uri=, User Request with =/api/v1/products/123= will be Destination Service, =/api/v1/products/123=
