I just created my own function to copy my image into =hugo= image directory. But there are already many functions related to images in the =hugo=. It's not matter. I can easily copy some code from ~easy-hugo.el~. 
just fun.



#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun easy-hugo-mycopy-image ()
    "copy my image into hugo image directory
  2022-12-29 by Inchul"
    (interactive)
    (let ((easy-hugo-img-dir (concat easy-hugo-basedir "/static/images/") )
          (my-img-dir easy-hugo-default-picture-directory))
      (if (eq nil my-img-dir) 
          (message "my hugo dir is nil" ))
                                          ;    (copy-file file putfile)
                                          ;(message "my hugo dir is %s" easy-hugo-img-dir)
                                          ;(message "my private image dir is %s" my-img-dir)
      (let* ((file (read-file-name "Image file to copy into blog: " my-img-dir
                                   nil
                                   t
                                   nil))
             (putfile (expand-file-name
                       (file-name-nondirectory file)
                       (expand-file-name easy-hugo-img-dir))))
                                          ;(message "selected filename: %s" file)
                                          ;(message "putfile dir: %s" putfile)
        (copy-file file putfile)
#+end_src
- I can learn some ~elisp~ functions from this such as ~concat~, ~read-file-name~, ~expand-file-name~, ~file-name-nondirectory~, ~copy-file~.


next time, I will try to improve it that can make it multi-files
