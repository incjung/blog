how often do you open a file in emacs? Of course, Emacs is a Text editer, so you must be opening files many times. I am keeping my idea and thoughts with ~org-mode~ files, so many file path links used in the files.
Surely, it's no problem when it's URLs. Just click it. But when it's file path, unless you made it with link, you should drive onto the path directly. ~C-x C-j~, dired, is your frend. But it's opening so many dired buffers.

So I just wrote a simple elisp to open a file path in text.

~thing-at-point~ will get the path string if there is no spaces, but some cases there are, you should mark the path manually.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-open-file-at-point (args)
    "directly open file at point
  2023-05-11"
    (interactive "P")
    (let (tMarkedstr)
      (setq tMarkedstr
            (if (use-region-p)
                (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end))
              (thing-at-point 'filename)))
      (deactivate-mark)
      (message "%s" tMarkedstr)
      (find-file (read-string "open? " tMarkedstr))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "<f4>") 'my-open-file-at-point)
#+end_src

keep hacking!!
