This is perhaps only for me. when I read a book, to keep in my mind. These day, I am very interested in graded readers book. Because I am feeling that my english skill is not going to improve more. Fortunately, I met some youtube links about it. I thought it's really useful. 

I think the suitable book is having workds which I can understand most (95%) of the words on each page.
