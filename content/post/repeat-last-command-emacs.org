~C-x z~ is *repeat* command to repeat most recently executed command in emacs.

For example, after split my window, I can enlarge my current window with ~C-x ^~ binding to *enlarge-window* function. On the other hand, to shrink my window, I run =M-x shrink-window= which is no binding in my emacs over and over until I am satisfied. How many typing I need to do !!!

Now, =M-x shrink-widow= can follow by =C-x z=, which is repeating the window shrinking. and you can repeat it by simply holding down the last key, =z=.
