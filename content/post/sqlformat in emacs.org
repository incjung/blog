No idea how annoying to use `sql-mode'. There should be some useful and beautiful formatters or beautifiers. I did do research and google some but not sure what is my best choice. 
Just let's try. Firstly, I found [[https://pypi.org/project/sqlparse/][sqlparse]]. Way easy to install because it's python library. 

** =pip install sqlparse=
#+begin_src bash
  pip install sqlparse

  python -m sqlparse -h
  #+end_src

If you don't like to install but just to test it, you can go to [[https://sqlformat.org/][online formatter]].

not bad? let's make a function and add it to init.org. 
** add =init.org=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-sql-format-region ()
    "Format SQL in region using `sqlparse'."
    (interactive)
    (shell-command-on-region (region-beginning) (region-end)
                             "python -m sqlparse -r -"
                             "MY-Converted-SQL-BUFFER"
                           t))
#+end_src
